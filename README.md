# Computer Vision Basics

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects exploring fundamental and intermediate concepts in **Computer Vision**. All projects are implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** using **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Pandas**.

## Volume 01: Computer Vision Basics

The first notebook introduces basic image processing techniques and operations. It's meant as a hands-on way to stay consistent with learning Computer Vision fundamentals.

### Projects included:
- RGB Channels and Histogram
- Crop, Rotate and Translate
- Thresholding
- Scaling and Brightness
- Morphological Operations
- Smoothing Images
- Masks
- Edge Detection
- Filter Vignette
- Face and Eye Detection with Haar's Cascades
- Feature Detection and Matching

## Volume 02: Computer Vision Basics v2

This second notebook continues the learning journey with slightly more advanced projects.

### Projects included:
- K-means Clustering for Segmentation
- Skew Correction
- Detect Templates in Images
- Color Balancing *(In Progress)*
- Blur the Face
- Cartoonize an Image
- Photo Sketching
- Generate, Detect and Read QR Code
